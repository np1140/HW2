# Assignment 2 - Advanced Machine Learning

This project is part of Assignment 2 for the Advanced Machine Learning course. It includes implementations and modifications of generative models, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), applied to well-known datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
